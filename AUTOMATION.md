# 🤖 Daily Dad Jokes - Automated Generation

This document explains how to set up automated daily joke generation for your Daily Dad Jokes website.

## 🎯 What It Does

The automation system will:
- ✅ **Check daily** if tomorrow's joke exists
- 🎭 **Generate a fresh dad joke** if needed
- 🎨 **Create an AI-generated image** using your existing pipeline
- 📝 **Update the database** automatically
- 📊 **Update the joke counter** on the website

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Set Up the Cron Job

```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup-cron.sh
```

This creates a cron job that runs **daily at 6:00 PM** to generate tomorrow's joke.

### 2. Manual Test

Test the script manually first:

```bash
# Test generating tomorrow's joke
node daily-joke-generator.js
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Check that cron job was created
crontab -l

# Monitor the logs
tail -f cron.log
```

## 📅 Scheduling Details

**Default Schedule**: Every day at 6:00 PM (18:00)
```
0 18 * * * cd /path/to/project && node daily-joke-generator.js >> cron.log 2>&1
```

### Change the Schedule

Edit your crontab to run at different times:

```bash
crontab -e
```

**Examples**:
- `0 9 * * *` - Daily at 9:00 AM
- `0 0 * * *` - Daily at midnight
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours

## 🎭 How Joke Generation Works

### Current Implementation
- Uses a curated list of 20 fresh dad jokes
- Randomly selects one for each day
- Ensures no duplicates (checks existing jokes)

### Future Enhancements
You can integrate with AI services like:
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for unlimited joke generation
- **Claude API** for creative dad jokes
- **Custom fine-tuned models** for your specific style

Example OpenAI integration:
```javascript
const generateDadJoke = async () => {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [{
            role: "user",
            content: "Generate a family-friendly dad joke that's clever and punny"
        }]
    });
    return {
        joke: response.choices[0].message.content,
        category: "ai-generated"
    };
};
```

## 🎨 Image Generation Pipeline

The system uses your existing image generation infrastructure:
1. **Reuses `replace-image.js`** for consistency
2. **Same AI prompting** as manual generation
3. **Automatic Google Cloud upload** and URL updates
4. **Quota management** with multi-endpoint failover

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### Check Logs
```bash
# View recent activity
tail -20 cron.log

# Watch live
tail -f cron.log

# Search for errors
grep "ERROR\|Failed" cron.log
```

### Log Rotation
Add to your cron for log management:
```bash
# Weekly log rotation (run Sundays at 2 AM)
0 2 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && mv cron.log cron.log.old && touch cron.log
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cron job not running?**
```bash
# Check cron service is running
sudo service cron status

# Check system logs
grep CRON /var/log/syslog
```

**Permission errors?**
```bash
# Ensure script is executable
chmod +x daily-joke-generator.js

# Check file permissions
ls -la daily-jokes.json
```

**Missing dependencies?**
```bash
# Install packages
npm install

# Check environment variables
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log(process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS)"
```

## 🎯 Customization

### Add More Jokes
Edit `daily-joke-generator.js` and add to the `freshJokes` array:

```javascript
const freshJokes = [
    { joke: "Your new joke here!", category: "wordplay" },
    // ... more jokes
];
```

### Change Categories
Available categories:
- `wordplay` - Puns and word-based humor
- `animals` - Animal-themed jokes
- `food` - Food and cooking jokes
- `technology` - Tech-related humor
- `sports` - Sports jokes
- `music` - Musical humor
- `school` - Educational jokes

### Modify Timing
The script runs at 6 PM to give you time to review before the next day. Adjust as needed for your timezone and preferences.

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Production Deployment
- Ensure cron runs on your production server
- Set up proper environment variables
- Configure log rotation
